For instance, you can hear something like \u201cSkoltech Policy on Student Scholarships and Other Benefits\u201d or \u201cSkoltech\u2019s IP policy\u201d, which, btw, you will learn about in the next modules.

In fact, before a policy is drafted, **Skoltech makes sure to give the students the opportunity to voice their concerns or opinions** on the issue in question through the Student Council.

As a student, you have incredible freedom to explore your passions, try your hand in different subject areas and even work-related activities. This university was literally built to open your abilities and your mind, to help you reach for incredible goals and achieve them.

Some are just good, logical practices \\- like no running \\- while others are strictly prohibited for everyone\u2019s safety \\- like no food or drinks in laboratories. *Text Overlay: Ground Rules and Safety*\n\nFor a start, you should know that the campus is closed to visitors without a pass. That\u2019s basically anyone who is not a student or an employee of Skoltech. Each visitor \\- even your mom and girlfriend \\- will need a pass to enter the halls beyond the security line. Talk to the Education Office if you need a guest pass for someone as an exception. It is prohibited to: \n\n* ### smoke tobacco products, as well as evaporative mixtures used in devices for \n\n* ### drink alcoholic beverages (including beer and other low-alcohol drinks);\n\n* ### generating aerosol, steam, or smoke outside designated areas, use open fire, including in areas directly adjacent to buildings;\n\n* ### perform actions that violate/change the designated modes of operation of technical means of protection and fire alarm;\n\n* ### use evacuation and emergency exits to enter the building, as well as exit the building in the absence of factors that threaten the life and health of citizens;\n\n* ### ride bicycles inside the buildings;\n\n* ### place bicycles, scooters, electric scooters, skateboards, gyro scooters, segways, unicycles in places not intended for parking and attaching them to poles, building facades, trees, etc. * ### ride inside the buildings and in outdoor areas on roller skates, scooters, electric scooters, skateboards, gyroscooters, segways, unicycles at \u0430 speed of more than 10 km/h.",

If you decide to drive your own car, you will first need to order a security pass to enter the Skolkovo Innovation Center Territory. Without this pass, security will not let you through the territory gates no matter how hard you try to convince them.

Always\\! * No food or drinks  \n* Do not work in the FabLab without an employee accompanying you (for safety reasons)   \n* Pay attentions to signs on machinery and equipment  \n* Do not try to access rooms or areas marked with red lines  \n* Be extra careful around yellow lines\n\n *Text Overlay:* \n\n* *Every new student needs to pass the EHS induction training and safety training provided by a responsible person before lab access.*  \n* *Always wear safety goggles and other required means of personal protection.

That equipment is marked with a special sign. If you want to use it, ask the FabLab team about training. Speaking of the FabLab team, they are your most valuable resource\\! All of the FabLab employees are trained experts. You can consult with them about your projects, get help with any equipment and, of course, learn from them. At this point you may be asking, \u201cWhat about other labs?\u201d\n\nDuh, Skoltech has dozens of labs with fascinating and unique equipment\\! To save you some time and intrigue right now, we won\u2019t go into detail about each and every lab here.

As an educational institution, it should come to you as no surprise that there are some rules to ensure your safety. Some are just good, logical practices \\- like no running \\- while others are strictly prohibited for everyone\u2019s safety \\- like no food or drinks in laboratories. *Text Overlay: Ground Rules and Safety*\n\nFor a start, you should know that the campus is closed to visitors without a pass. That\u2019s basically anyone who is not a student or an employee of Skoltech. Each visitor \\- even your mom and girlfriend \\- will need a pass to enter the halls beyond the security line. Talk to the Education Office if you need a guest pass for someone as an exception. It is prohibited to: \n\n* ### smoke tobacco products, as well as evaporative mixtures used in devices for \n\n* ### drink alcoholic beverages (including beer and other low-alcohol drinks);\n\n* ### generating aerosol, steam, or smoke outside designated areas, use open fire, including in areas directly adjacent to buildings;\n\n* ### perform actions that violate/change the designated modes of operation of technical means of protection and fire alarm;\n\n* ### use evacuation and emergency exits to enter the building, as well as exit the building in the absence of factors that threaten the life and health of citizens;\n\n* ### ride bicycles inside the buildings;\n\n* ### place bicycles, scooters, electric scooters, skateboards, gyro scooters, segways, unicycles in places not intended for parking and attaching them to poles, building facades, trees, etc. * ### ride inside the buildings and in outdoor areas on roller skates, scooters, electric scooters, skateboards, gyroscooters, segways, unicycles at \u0430 speed of more than 10 km/h.",

When it comes to course registration, we mostly expect you to register for courses yourself with some exceptions. For instance, the Education Department has already registered you for your first course \\- Innovation Workshop :) \n\nFor standard terms (so, not Term 1A), registration will happen about 3 weeks before the start of the term (check the calendar\\!). Here\u2019s a quick timeline: \n\n*Graph:* \n\n![][image11]\n\nSide note:  Short-term projects follow regular registration schedule\n\nSo how do you register for your courses?As we\u2019ve already mentioned, you do not need to register for any courses in Term 1A \\- you are already signed up for a compulsory course called Innovation Workshop. Instructions on how to register for the other terms will be sent to you individually by the Education Department. Meanwhile, you can explore [the courses offered in 2022-2023](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) (and in the upcoming terms) [using the link below](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/course-catalog/) and choose which ones you want to register for. You can filter courses based on your program, credit load, and instructors. After you\u2019ve registered for courses, you will be added to your course \u201cpage\u201d on Canvas. Here you will see information about your registered courses, your grades, assignments, group work and more. Make sure to bookmark Canvas in your browser and check it for updates from your professors and program coordinators on a daily basis\\! As a student, you have rights and channels for feedback. As Skoltech constantly works on improving this communication, please be aware of the following:\n\nYour student rights:\n\n* To obtain full information on your courses and educational programs, course syllabi, assessment criteria and feedback on your progress  \n* To provide your feedback on the quality of courses\n\n At the end of each course, you will be asked to submit a formal evaluation of the coursework, the course load and your professor, course instructor and teaching assistant. These evaluations are used to collect your *anonymous* feedback on each of your learning experiences. The feedback is then followed-up to Education Department, course instructors and program coordinators. If you need to communicate any concerns or issues informally or outside of the formal evaluation period (or if you are unable to solve an issue directly with your research advisor or faculty, please talk to the [Education Department](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/21) \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438.

In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. ![][image7]The campus is located within the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory a few minutes away from the center of Moscow. The campus is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which is a closed territory. This means you may need a car pass if you decide to drive here. So, you can reach the campus in multiple ways. **First, you can use public transportation.** \n\nThis is the safest and surest way to reach the campus if you need to be there by a certain time (or just want your arrival time to be predictable). No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow\u2019s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \\#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It\u2019s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You\u2019ll need to exit the train at the \u201cMCD Skolkovo\u201d (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e) station. Once you arrive, take the stairs, escalator or an elevator to the second floor and walk down the looooong hall of the Orbion building. Then, once again, go down to the 1st floor and exit. Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you\u2019ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker. Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we\u2019ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10)\n\nBy the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory. Visit [https://sk.ru/transport/](https://sk.ru/transport/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://sk.ru/transport/)\n\nfor more information. ![][image8]\n\n \n\nThe next best thing is to take a taxi\n\nCurrently, only taxi services [Yandex (links to an external site)](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\\_ru/) , [Citi Mobil](https://city-mobil.ru/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://city-mobil.ru/) , and [Uber  (links to an external site)](https://support-uber.com/) have automatic access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center. All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type \u201c\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0445\u201d in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don\u2019t forget to buckle up\\! If you take a different taxi service, you\u2019ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time. To order a pass for your taxi, email security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address with your taxi\u2019s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, \u0425111\u0421\u041a197).",

On top of that, we\u2019ll discuss the Education Process, which covers Academic Structure, the Grading System, and Course Registration. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Academic Integrity : Academic Misconduct , Disciplinary Measures*  \n- *Education Process : Academic structure, grading system, course registration* \n\n\nLet\u2019s start with Academic Integrity. It relies on our community\u2019s personal values and policies on ethics, conflict of interest, and others. We expect everyone to: \n\n- Follow professional courtesy  \n- Be committed to honesty without compromising their values  \n- Promote the truth without compromise\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Follow professional courtesy*  \n- *Be committed to honesty without compromising their values*  \n- *Promote the truth without compromise*\n\nThis is very important because it leads to the respectful culture that you develop in terms of how you conduct your academic studies, publish in top journals recognized in the most prominent fields, and other achievements. If, at any stage or time, the integrity of your studies is compromised, you will enter the realms of academic misconduct. *Text Overlay: academic misconduct.*\n\nFormal definitions of academic misconduct say that it is the intent of the individual participating in this to cheat the system in some way to gain something in return. \u200b\u200bWhat\u2019s considered academic misconduct? * Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work  \n* Fabrication or falsification of data  \n* Unauthorized collaboration  \n* Plagiarism  \n* Cheating\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n* *Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work*  \n* *Fabrication or falsification of data*  \n* *Unauthorized collaboration*  \n* *Plagiarism*  \n* *Cheating*\n\nResearch Misconduct includes such offenses as:\n\n* Substitution of data  \n* Unrealistic precision of data  \n* Results that contradict known physics\n\n*Text Overlay: Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:*\n\n* *Substitution of data*  \n* *Unrealistic precision of data*  \n* *Results that contradict known physics*\n\nYou can learn more about disciplinary actions by clicking the link below. Discipline is an important part of any academic organization, and in this case Skoltech is no exception. Students who cheat, plagiarize or participate in any other form of academic or research misconduct (including failing classes and violating full time status) are subject to an evaluation by the Skoltech Disciplinary Board (DB). *Text Overlays: Disciplinary Measures at Skoltech*\n\nIf a faculty member witnesses a student\u2019s academic misconduct, the student\u2019s name will be submitted to the Disciplinary Board. Both the student and the witness will be given a chance to explain their positions in writing. Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision regarding the student\u2019s status at Skoltech.

No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow\u2019s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \\#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It\u2019s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You\u2019ll need to exit the train at the \u201cMCD Skolkovo\u201d (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e) station.

Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you\u2019ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker.

Then it\u2019s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year. Right now, you don\u2019t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor. So, here are a few tips:\n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class. There\u2019s a difference \n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class. There\u2019s a difference \n\nNow onto Academic Mobility \u2014 Network Programs, Exchange Programs, Short & Long Term Academic Trips, and Conferences. *Text Overlay: Academic Mobility \u2014 Network Programs, Exchange Programs, Short & Long Term Academic Trips, Conferences.* \n\nLet\u2019s begin with Academic Mobility Options, Academic Trips, and Conferences. Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\. Moving on to Funding. *Text Overlay: Funding*\n\nCan be provided from a research advisor\u2019s funds or a CREI budget. Long-Term trips are supported by Education Department. We have prepared information on how to apply for you, along with guidelines for reporting after the academic trip, which you can find in the description below. You can also find out more about your Student Status \u2014 Active Status Requirements, Academic Leave, Withdrawal & Reinstatement. Please take the time to study this in detail. *Text Overlay : Student Status \u2014 Active Status Requirements, Academic Leave, Withdrawal & Reinstatement.* \n",

Students have full access to the facilities throughout their studies and can conduct research based on their interests in IT, Biomedicine, Energy, Space, Cross Cutting Science. As part of your MSc Thesis project, you will develop very specific studies that go deep into one of the following topics: \n\n- Molecular and Cellular Biology  \n- Agro Technologies  \n- Neurobiology and Brain Rehabilitation  \n- Artificial Intelligence Technology  \n- Energy Science and Technology  \n- Petroleum Science and Engineering  \n- Materials Technologies  \n- Digital Engineering  \n- Advanced Studies  \n- Photonic Science and Engineering  \n- Engineering Physics  \n- Materials Science\n\n*Text Overlay:*  \n\n- *Molecular and Cellular Biology*  \n- *Agro Technologies*  \n- *Neurobiology and Brain Rehabilitation*  \n- *Artificial Intelligence Technology*  \n- *Energy Science and Technology*  \n- *Petroleum Science and Engineering*  \n- *Materials Technologies*  \n- *Digital Engineering*  \n- *Advanced Studies*  \n- *Photonic Science and Engineering*  \n- *Engineering Physics*  \n- *Materials Science* \n\nYour research advisor will most likely be a part of the relevant laboratory and CREI. You can explore the different centers\u2019 missions and ongoing projects on the Skoltech website, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e. Now onto Library Resources. *Text Overlay:  Library Resources.* \n\nNow what\u2019s one of the most essential elements of conducting research? That\u2019s right, resources\\! And one place to find them is at the Skoltech Library. The Skoltech library is not only about books for loan, it is an academic hub for learning outside a classroom and doing research outside a lab. It combines digital infrastructure and a self-directed learning space located on the third floor of the Skoltech campus. In the library students can discover, analyze, share information, and create new knowledge. There are designated areas either for group collaboration or silent individual study, which makes the library your go-to place for any type of work. The library\u2019s mission is to provide you with access to knowledge. The library\u2019s key services include:\n\n- access to leading journals in various scientific disciplines  \n- access to bibliographic databases, materials tools, a patent database, analytical tools, etc. - access to scientific and business literature (both ebooks and hard copies)  \n- access to PhD and MSc theses of Skoltech graduates  \n- assistance in using digital resources and searching for information\n\nIn short, you can go to the library for research support, assistance with access to digital resources (more on that below) and even some educational events organized by the library team for you. In addition, the library team encourages students\u2019 initiatives and assists in facilitating evens organized by the students themselves. Resources, journals and publications\n\n[The library website](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/library/)  contains updated information related to subscribed resources and access to them. We\u2019ve linked the library website in the description. You have access to numerous high-quality scientific knowledge databases and the latest scientific information. You can find full-text databases, e-books, materials databases, patent databases and more. Now how do you find these digital scientific resources? While on campus and connected to Skoltech WiFi, you can access them seamlessly via the Skoltech Library website. While off-campus, please follow the remote access instructions from the library's website. In most cases, you will be asked to log in using your Skoltech credentials (see the full guide in the description). If you want to check out books, you can use the self-checkout machines (and your Student ID) at the library. However, to gain access the first time you want to check out a book, you will need to introduce yourself to the library team, for them to create your account in their system and show how self-checkout works. Don't forget your campus pass as that is necessary to activate your access to the lock on the door to the library's books. The checkout period is 2 weeks, and you can borrow or return the books from the library 24/7. To reach the library or ask questions, email the team at Library@skoltech.ru .",

Also of course sport clubs (which, at the same time, are official student sport teams: football, basketball, volleyball and others. Fun fact: every autumn, the students of Skoltech gather together for a Club Fair and hold a showcase of available and new clubs you can join. Stay tuned, the Student Council will announce the registration and the dates for this year\u2019s Club Fair in September-October 2022\\. At the Club Fair you can look for existing clubs or present your own new one, though that will take some prep work beforehand. Skoltech will support your club and even provide financinacing (if needed) with proper reasons:) How to start your own club at Skoltech\n\n1. Fill out an application before the annual Club Fair. You will receive an email with the details and instructions beforehand (if you decide to start a club in the middle of the year, talk to the Student Council first). 2. Send your application to the Student Council by the deadline for that year. 3. Present your club at the Club Fair, find your first members  \n4. After the Club Fair the Student Council will collect and assess the requests from all Clubs regarding necessary equipment for their activities. A few rules for running clubs: \n\n* A club needs to have a club leader and up to 2 deputy leaders (deputies are optional). They are elected for 1 year. * The club members must meet regularly \\- at least once a month. * You will need to provide monthly reports about your club\u2019s activities (events, outings, meetings) to the Student Council Club coordinator. Goooo Skoltech\\! Amid all the studying and research, it\u2019s important to keep up your physical activity. And we know some of you are excellent sports people.

Upon your arrival in Moscow, you\u2019ll probably want to go to your accommodation and relax. No matter what accommodation type you will have booked (we\u2019ll talk about it in the next section), here are some general tips on how to navigate the city of Moscow on your first day. To start, in the description, you can find links to files you may need to access quickly \n\nMoving on to Currency, bank cards and cash. *Text Overlay: Currency, bank cards and cash*\n\nAs of 2022, foreign-issued bank cards are not accepted in Moscow, so you will not be able to pay with a bank card at the cash register. As you arrive at the airport and pass security, head straight for the currency exchange shop. Don\u2019t exchange all your money, as the exchange rates at the airport are notoriously bad, but do exchange enough for your first day in the city (aka to travel to your accommodation, treat yourself to a meal and buy a cell phone SIM card). You will likely need between 2 500 \\- 3 000 RUB. Afterwards, you can find an official bank with a better exchange rate and exchange your currency there. Your trip will most likely start from a big transport hub, like the airport / railway station. There should be free WI-FI in case your home service provider doesn't allow you to connect to a cell network in Moscow. We recommend visiting an official shop of any Russian mobile network (MTS (links to an external site), Megafon (links to an external site), Beeline (links to an external site), Tele2 (links to an external site)) and purchasing a SIM-card. You will need to show your passport. The probability that staff of such shops in airports or in railway stations speak English is higher than anywhere else. *A graphic with app icons and telecom operators goes here.* \n\nIn order to use the internet on your first day in Moscow you can use public Wi-Fi. Most streets in the city center, parks and almost all public transport provide free internet access. Wi-Fi networks are available at over 1,000 locations. Each of them will be marked accordingly to keep you informed. To connect, select \"Moscow\\_Wi-Fi\\_Free\" among accessible networks, open the browser and register. This can be done through text messages; you should enter your Russian phone number, and receive a text message with a code. We also advise you to bring a powerbank with you (most airlines and railway carriers allow you to carry a 20 000 mAh power bank). To make it easy for you to navigate Moscow, we have compiled a list of navigation apps for you.",

The schedule of the dorms doesn\u2019t affect you, your apartment is your own private space, and only you get to decide whom to invite to visit, and when they have to leave, if at all. You can find options in locations convenient to you as well. On the other hand, you will need to go through the migration registration procedure with your landlord. Your other option is to live in the Skoltech Dormitory. Here, you will be surrounded by your fellow students, who will always find the time to help solve major issues, or even simply share a meal and dispel boredom with conversation. The dorms are located near the campus, meaning you\u2019re always within walking distance of your classes. Your migration registration also becomes a non-issue, since the dormitory will handle that for you. However, keep in mind that the dorms have their own rules, which were created for the comfort of everyone who lives there. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the Skoltech dorms. *Text Overlay: Skoltech Dormitories*\n\nThe dormitory apartment complex is called Palisad, so you will probably hear that name a lot. Palisad is located near the Technopark, which is within a 20 minute walk or a quick 5 minute bus ride. You choose what you like\\! Palisad is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which means students get access to the same facilities as all Skolkovo residents:\n\n* Good transport infrastructure, including bicycles and easy transportation on the Skolkovo territory. * Food & shopping locations, including grocery stores, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and many other things. There are some malls for shopping and entertainment within a comfortable driving distance. * Skolkovo sports & recreation facilities and parks  \n* Separate garbage collection and utilization\n\nThe Palisad Dormitory has 5 types of apartments, which are categorized based on the students' level of studies and status (Master's, PhD, families, etc.). Palisad does not have an opportunity for single accommodation. Students with disabilities are accommodated in specially equipped apartments accompanying a medical assistant or a family member, if approved by the dorm manager/curator. *Text Overlay: Students with disabilities*\n\nMaster's students are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 3-6 people. You will get up to 5 roommates. Allocation conditions for MSc students under the HRH Princess of Thailand program are established in separate regulations. *Text Overlay: Master's students*\n\nPhD students are allocated in studios, 1 and 2-bedroom apartments in groups of 2-3 people. You will get up to 2 roommates. *Text Overlay: PhD students* \n\nMarried couples and Families are being accommodated in studios with a maximum capacity of 2\\. Children of up to 18 y.o. could be accommodated free of charge together with their parents in case of confirmed family accommodation. Additional beds for children are not provided and are subject to your own responsibility. Studios for families with children and for married couples are similar in space and configuration. *Text Overlay: Married couples and Families*\n\nOther Students (visiting, prospective students) who require short-term accommodation (less than an academic year) are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 4-6 people. You will get up to 3 roommates. Accommodation for prospective students is free when the student stays for a maximum of 3 nights. *Text Overlay: Other Students*\n\nOnto the Dormitory fees. *Text Overlay: Dormitory fees.* \n\nAccommodation rates are established once per year and published on the Accommodation Website, the link to which you can find in the description. You can also find the information on reserving a space in standard rooms there. Remember, students that meet the appropriate requirements can get a discount of up to 55% off for master\u2019s students and up to 45% for PhD students. *Text Overlay: Master\u2019s \\- 55%, PhD \\- 45%* \n\nSo what\u2019s included in this? Apartments are fully equipped for living, including bed linen and kitchen utensils. Cleaning is provided 2 times per month; however, students are fully responsible for keeping the apartment and facilities fully clean and in working order. In addition, there is Wi-Fi in each apartment. Religious attributes, personal electronic devices \\[including hairdryer\\] and household items and chemicals are to be purchased by students depending on individual needs. If student dorms aren\u2019t your thing, you can always rent an apartment independently. *Text Overlay: Apartment rental*\n\nYou will have full freedom of movement, set your own schedule, choose your preferred location, number of rooms and so on. But, this also means that you will need to cover the rental costs yourself, connect with your landlord, sign the lease agreements, and take care of your government migration documentation independently. You will search for an apartment independently, however, we are here to provide informational assistance for you to help you find the most convenient and comfortable place to stay. According to Russia's Federal Law of Migration, each international student/tourist/visitor should be registered. It is a lengthy bureaucratic process required for all visitors. You can look for an apartment flat in different districts near Skolkovo: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe. *Text Overlay: Suggested locations: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe.*\n\nThe closest metro stations like Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard have bus stops with direct routes to Skolkovo and should get you to the campus within 45 minutes. *Text Overlay: Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard* \n\nWe suggest you choose an area near D1 stations of MCD (Moscow Central Diameters). *Text Overlay: D1 stations of MCD (Moscow Central Diameters).*\n\n*A map of the subway should go here.* \n\nYou can find a more detailed instruction with links to verified apps, as well advice on safely looking for a place to live below.

Your other option is to live in the Skoltech Dormitory.

[This website  (links to an external site)](https://www.tripsavvy.com/basic-russian-vocabulary-for-travelers-4165285) will be a good start. While it\u2019s likely that most people on your way to Skoltech will try to understand and help you, they always appreciate a smart and respectful traveler :)\n\nFeel free to save this information in your smartphone for easy access in [pdf](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2)   \n[Links to an external site](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2) or [jpeg (links to an external site)](https://box.skoltech.ru/index.php/s/GAjwDXjONG9YMa2)\n\nWe recommend visiting an official shop of any Russian mobile network ([MTS](https://moskva.mts.ru/personal/mobilnaya-svyaz/tarifi/vse-tarifi) , [Megafon](https://moscow.megafon.ru/tariffs/all/), [Beeline](https://moskva.beeline.ru/customers/pomosh/new-client/tarify/) , [Tele2](https://msk.tele2.ru/tariffs)) and purchasing a SIM-card\n\nNavigation resources (apps, maps and cards)\n\nTo make it easy for you to navigate Moscow, we have compiled a list of navigation apps for you. Download them *before* your trip\\! To navigate the metro you will need the [Yandex Metro](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/metro) app, for navigation in public transport you will need a [Yandex Maps app](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/maps) \n\nand taxi apps like [Yandex Taxi](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/taxi). Feel free to download and save [this picture of the Moscow Metro map](https://mosmetro.ru/metro-map/?utm\\_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fmosmetro.ru%2fdownload%2fs.jpg%3futm\\_referrer%3dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww.google.com%252f) as well. Lastly, we also recommend to purchase [transportation card Troika](https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/31475073/)  (in Russian: \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430). This card allows you to pay less for each journey on public transport. You can buy a card in any metro station (central metro stations have English speaking staff or you can do this in a ticket vending machine). How to get to your accommodation from the airport\n\nIf you need to get to the Skoltech dormitories, the exact address is Moscow, Skolkovo Innovation Center, Kulibina st., 2/2 (in Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, \u0418\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e, \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430 2/2)\n\n* By taxi: If you don't want to worry about taking public transport on your first day, you can always order a taxi directly from the airport or the railway station directly to the Skoltech dormitories or your planned accommodation. We recommend using the [Uber App](https://support-uber.com/) or [Yandex Taxi](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\\_ru/) (which have open access to the Skolkovo territory). You\u2019ll see the price in advance, would be able to choose the type of the vehicle (considering your bags) and can pay by credit card if you don't have cash on you yet. * By public transport: It\u2019s likely your flight will land in one of Moscow\u2019s key airports: Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo or Domodedovo. All three airports have an [Aeroexpress train](https://aeroexpress.ru/en/aero/schedule.html) that connects the airports to major metro stations. The Aeroexpress leaves approximately every 30 minutes and requires a separate ticket, which you can purchase in front of the entrance to the train platform. \u2192 As you arrive at the final stop of the Aeroexpress train (which will be in the center of the city), walk over to the closest metro station (marked with a big red M), look at the metro map and travel to the metro station closest to your accommodation. You can use the[Yandex Metro](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/metro)  app to plan your route. \u2192 If you\u2019re traveling to the Skoltech Dormitories, you\u2019ll need to go to the Slavyansky Bulvar metro station which will be located on the dark blue metro line. \u2192 Then, at Slavyansky Bulvar, you\u2019ll need to make a connection to the MCD station with the same name and go in the direction of Odintsovo. \u2192 The stop you\u2019ll need is called Skolkovo \\- does that sound familiar? :) \n\n\u2192 From there, take an SK1 shuttle and exit at the Technopark stop. The Skoltech dorms will be on your right\\! [Here](https://old.sk.ru/city/transport/p/inner.aspx) you will find the exact map of bus routes around Skolkovo. First of all, all information regarding accommodation can be found on [accommodation.skoltech.ru (links to an external site)](https://accommodation.skoltech.ru/)\n\n**Dormitory fees**\n\nAccommodation rates are established once per year and published on the [Accommodation Website](http://accommodation.skoltech.ru/)  The general price per bed for the 2022-2023 academic year is 25850 RUB per bed per month, but eligible Skoltech students get some nice discounts (55% off for MSc students and 45% off for PhD students). Please keep in mind that details like pricing and deadlines are subject to change, so it\u2019s best to double check your reservation details with the dormitory manager once you get to that stage. **How to request a spot in the dormitories**\n\nIf you are ready to request a spot in the dorms, visit [accommodation.skoltech.ru/booking](https://accommodation.skoltech.ru/booking) or our [HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.skoltech.ru/servicedesk/customer/portal/28/create/485) . It\u2019s highly recommended to leave your request only *after* you\u2019ve received special communication from the Admissions Office.

    "context": "This way, you get to set your own personal rules (as long as your landlord agrees, of course. You can live alone or with friends, that\u2019s up to you. The schedule of the dorms doesn\u2019t affect you, your apartment is your own private space, and only you get to decide whom to invite to visit, and when they have to leave, if at all. You can find options in locations convenient to you as well. On the other hand, you will need to go through the migration registration procedure with your landlord. Your other option is to live in the Skoltech Dormitory. Here, you will be surrounded by your fellow students, who will always find the time to help solve major issues, or even simply share a meal and dispel boredom with conversation. The dorms are located near the campus, meaning you\u2019re always within walking distance of your classes. Your migration registration also becomes a non-issue, since the dormitory will handle that for you. However, keep in mind that the dorms have their own rules, which were created for the comfort of everyone who lives there. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the Skoltech dorms. *Text Overlay: Skoltech Dormitories*\n\nThe dormitory apartment complex is called Palisad, so you will probably hear that name a lot. Palisad is located near the Technopark, which is within a 20 minute walk or a quick 5 minute bus ride. You choose what you like\\! Palisad is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which means students get access to the same facilities as all Skolkovo residents:\n\n* Good transport infrastructure, including bicycles and easy transportation on the Skolkovo territory. * Food & shopping locations, including grocery stores, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and many other things. There are some malls for shopping and entertainment within a comfortable driving distance. * Skolkovo sports & recreation facilities and parks  \n* Separate garbage collection and utilization\n\nThe Palisad Dormitory has 5 types of apartments, which are categorized based on the students' level of studies and status (Master's, PhD, families, etc.). Palisad does not have an opportunity for single accommodation. Students with disabilities are accommodated in specially equipped apartments accompanying a medical assistant or a family member, if approved by the dorm manager/curator. *Text Overlay: Students with disabilities*\n\nMaster's students are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 3-6 people. You will get up to 5 roommates. Allocation conditions for MSc students under the HRH Princess of Thailand program are established in separate regulations. *Text Overlay: Master's students*\n\nPhD students are allocated in studios, 1 and 2-bedroom apartments in groups of 2-3 people. You will get up to 2 roommates. *Text Overlay: PhD students* \n\nMarried couples and Families are being accommodated in studios with a maximum capacity of 2\\. Children of up to 18 y.o. could be accommodated free of charge together with their parents in case of confirmed family accommodation. Additional beds for children are not provided and are subject to your own responsibility. Studios for families with children and for married couples are similar in space and configuration. *Text Overlay: Married couples and Families*\n\nOther Students (visiting, prospective students) who require short-term accommodation (less than an academic year) are allocated in 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments in groups of 4-6 people. You will get up to 3 roommates. Accommodation for prospective students is free when the student stays for a maximum of 3 nights. *Text Overlay: Other Students*\n\nOnto the Dormitory fees. *Text Overlay: Dormitory fees.* \n\nAccommodation rates are established once per year and published on the Accommodation Website, the link to which you can find in the description. You can also find the information on reserving a space in standard rooms there. Remember, students that meet the appropriate requirements can get a discount of up to 55% off for master\u2019s students and up to 45% for PhD students. *Text Overlay: Master\u2019s \\- 55%, PhD \\- 45%* \n\nSo what\u2019s included in this? Apartments are fully equipped for living, including bed linen and kitchen utensils. Cleaning is provided 2 times per month; however, students are fully responsible for keeping the apartment and facilities fully clean and in working order. In addition, there is Wi-Fi in each apartment. Religious attributes, personal electronic devices \\[including hairdryer\\] and household items and chemicals are to be purchased by students depending on individual needs. If student dorms aren\u2019t your thing, you can always rent an apartment independently. *Text Overlay: Apartment rental*\n\nYou will have full freedom of movement, set your own schedule, choose your preferred location, number of rooms and so on. But, this also means that you will need to cover the rental costs yourself, connect with your landlord, sign the lease agreements, and take care of your government migration documentation independently. You will search for an apartment independently, however, we are here to provide informational assistance for you to help you find the most convenient and comfortable place to stay. According to Russia's Federal Law of Migration, each international student/tourist/visitor should be registered. It is a lengthy bureaucratic process required for all visitors. You can look for an apartment flat in different districts near Skolkovo: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe. *Text Overlay: Suggested locations: Tryokhgorka, Odintsovo, Nemchinovka, Novoivanovskoe.*\n\nThe closest metro stations like Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard have bus stops with direct routes to Skolkovo and should get you to the campus within 45 minutes. *Text Overlay: Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard* \n\nWe suggest you choose an area near D1 stations of MCD (Moscow Central Diameters). *Text Overlay: D1 stations of MCD (Moscow Central Diameters).*\n\n*A map of the subway should go here.* \n\nYou can find a more detailed instruction with links to verified apps, as well advice on safely looking for a place to live below.

Lastly, we also recommend to purchase [transportation card Troika](https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/31475073/)  (in Russian: \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430). This card allows you to pay less for each journey on public transport. You can buy a card in any metro station (central metro stations have English speaking staff or you can do this in a ticket vending machine). How to get to your accommodation from the airport\n\nIf you need to get to the Skoltech dormitories, the exact address is Moscow, Skolkovo Innovation Center, Kulibina st., 2/2 (in Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, \u0418\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e, \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430 2/2)\n\n* By taxi: If you don't want to worry about taking public transport on your first day, you can always order a taxi directly from the airport or the railway station directly to the Skoltech dormitories or your planned accommodation. We recommend using the [Uber App](https://support-uber.com/) or [Yandex Taxi](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\\_ru/) (which have open access to the Skolkovo territory). You\u2019ll see the price in advance, would be able to choose the type of the vehicle (considering your bags) and can pay by credit card if you don't have cash on you yet. * By public transport: It\u2019s likely your flight will land in one of Moscow\u2019s key airports: Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo or Domodedovo. All three airports have an [Aeroexpress train](https://aeroexpress.ru/en/aero/schedule.html) that connects the airports to major metro stations. The Aeroexpress leaves approximately every 30 minutes and requires a separate ticket, which you can purchase in front of the entrance to the train platform. \u2192 As you arrive at the final stop of the Aeroexpress train (which will be in the center of the city), walk over to the closest metro station (marked with a big red M), look at the metro map and travel to the metro station closest to your accommodation. You can use the[Yandex Metro](https://mobile.yandex.ru/apps/android/metro)  app to plan your route. \u2192 If you\u2019re traveling to the Skoltech Dormitories, you\u2019ll need to go to the Slavyansky Bulvar metro station which will be located on the dark blue metro line. \u2192 Then, at Slavyansky Bulvar, you\u2019ll need to make a connection to the MCD station with the same name and go in the direction of Odintsovo. \u2192 The stop you\u2019ll need is called Skolkovo \\- does that sound familiar? :) \n\n\u2192 From there, take an SK1 shuttle and exit at the Technopark stop.

You can plan your routes, see bus schedules (and moving buses), read and leavelocation reviews and more. This service is best adapted to the streets of Moscow and Russia. Download the app and use it when you need to. *Graphic: Yandex Maps icon* \n\nMoscow\u2019s public transportation system is extremely well-developed. *Text Overlay: Public transportation*\n\nThe buses, metro, trains and other city-sponsored modes of transfer are integrated by one system. You can buy yourself single- or double-ride tickets or get a permanent Troika card and top off its balance every once in a while. If you\u2019re planning to explore the city center, we recommend using the underground metro. Yandex Metro app (links to an external site)has the current map and allows you to plan your route to point A to point B. The metro is designed in a sun-like way, with multi-colored lines stemming away from the center outwards. There are also several circle lines which connect them. You will notice on the map (and have already seen it mentioned in this course) the MCD lines. These are newer extensions of the metro line that take you a little bit outside of the city for a few extra rubles. One of these lines, MCD 1, takes you almost directly to Skoltech and is the best way to get to campus from the city center. If you use the metro app to plan your route, select the stop called \u201cSkolkovo\u201d and it will calculate your route for you. Easy, huh\\! If you live or end up far away from a metro station, you can take the bus, a tramway or a small overground shuttle (aka marshrutka). The Yandex Transport app shows you the nearest stops, when the next bus, tram or shuttle will arrive there and where it can take you. You can also plan your route there. *Graphic: Yandex Transport icon*\n\nFinally, if you are in a huge rush, feel free to catch a taxi. Watch out if you\u2019re traveling to the campus, as not all services have automatic access to the Skolkovo Territory. Here\u2019s a quick list of apps you can use: \u044f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438, \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b, \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440. *Graphic: Yandex Taxi, Citimobil, Uber icons.* \n\nOh, almost forgot\\! When it gets warmer, you can rent electric scooters and bikes all around the city (and even in the Skolkovo Territory). If you see a little parking lot with scooters or bikes, look for a QR code to download its app and reserve yourself a machine. The system will tell you how long you have rented it for, its charge (if it\u2019s electric) and the nearest parking location. Just watch out for those puddles\\!

That\u2019s a long time away, so let\u2019s do a quick overview of how you can make it possible when you are ready. You will be legally required to leave the country within 3 days of graduation, even if your visa doesn\u2019t expire for a while. The reason for that is your purpose of stay will change \\- you will no longer be a student :(\n\nIf you wish to return for any reason \\- like if you get a job offer or simply want to relax here for a few months \\- you will need to go to your home country and get a new visa that aligns with your new purpose of stay. If you do not need a visa to enter Russia (if you\u2019re from a CIS country, for example), you will still need to leave and return, indicating a new purpose of stay at the customs. However, Skoltech can help you stay in Russia for a few extra weeks after graduation. You can file a request for a vacation via the Education Office and get a quick extension to wrap up your travels and check some items off your bucket list ;)  \n\nThis information will be communicated to you closer to your graduation, so you don\u2019t need to think about it too hard right now.
